DRAFT

Ban prima fase
Blue: Counter al tuo B1 o Target Ban;
Red: B1 che non vuoi affrontare o Target Ban;

Picks prima fase
B1: Blind e/o flex pick
R1, R2: Counter pick al B1, Blind e/o Flex pick;
B2, B3: Counter pick a R1 e R2, se hai preso flex pick prova a non romperlo(ADC), cerca sinergie con B1, se ci sono ruoli a rischio ban coprili;
R3: Un pick che ruoti l'identità del team se questa è counterata, o un counter pick specifico;

Ban seconda fase
Red: Counter al tuo R4 o target Ban su un ruolo non ancora coperto;
Blue: Possibili migliori R4, counter ai tuoi B4 e B5, se hai team advantage pivot picks;

Picks seconda fase
R4: Se hai un flex pick mantienilo, cerca di lasciare ruoli chiave per R5 (Top, Mid o Support);
B4, B5: Countera il piano del team nemico o rinforza il tuo piano, cerca di evitare champion con forti counter, se non è possibile pivot su pick comp;
R5: Un counter pick al laner o al piano nemico;

GOLDEN RULE
Sii creativo con i pick, non esistono pick oggettivamente migliori e giusti.

Dati Necessari per il calcolo dei team power points
- Classi Campioni:

.Catchers specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, 
entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat 
that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. 
Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, 
the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - 
both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.

.Enchanters focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness 
by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. 
Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, 
meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.

.Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition 
and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. 
They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, 
but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets
 due to their low range and extremely limited mobility.

.Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. 
Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, 
immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. 
Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, 
but Divers can take their fair share of punishment 
while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

.Burst mages aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down 
and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. 
They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, 
and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.

.Battlemages get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team 
with their overwhelming sustained area damage. 
Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, 
Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly 
to literally defying death for a short period of time.

.Artillery mages are the masters of range, 
and they leverage that advantage to whittle down their opponents over time from great distances. 
In turn, Artillery Mages are severely punished when enemies finally succeed in closing in on them,
due to their extreme fragility and limited mobility.

.Hypercarries are marksmen with the highest damage per second potential of the game.
They tend to be weak in early game and scale on late. Their goal is to melt enemies in mid-late game teamfights
due to their toolkit, but need to have team memebers who protect them because of their low mobility.

.Scouts are most well rounded and most spell reliant marksmen, they tend to have more utility then other marksmen's classes, 
providing vision, controls or good poke damage from their high range spells.
Scouts are generally good in all pahses of the game and perform in a large variety of compositions.

.Bullies are marksmen with high lane dominance, thanks to their good damage on early game and range,
their goal is to push out of lane their opponents and take advantage from early kills, towers and
early objectives. Also they have higher burst damage and less dps, 
so tend to be less efficient in late team fights.

.Slayers specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility
 to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. 
Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions 
in order to execute their targets. 
Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

.Skirmishers (also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. 
Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, 
they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray,
 along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

.Vanguards are offensive tanks. 
Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at bringing the action. 
Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to follow-up to devastating effect.

.Wardens are defensive tanks. 
Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers 
who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way 
and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.
